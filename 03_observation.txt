# Write down your observations and what did you learn new - in this file

Question 1
In this question  in the first half we have to return the count of a word in a sentence
we use re.sub() to sub characters with whitespaces and then we get a new string and then we
split the new string at whitespaces and run a for loop then we then we check for the word
in the sentence and return the count of the word.
in the second part, we return the list of the word in the given sentence for this we sub the
string with whiltespace by using sub() and using the special character \W and then we get
a new string which we split at whitespaces and then we get a list and run a for loop on the
obtained list and then we write a pattern for the presence of the given word and then if the
condition is true we append the word in a new list and return it
Question 2
In this question first we make use of \W to get only words and then we split the reduced
sentence at whitespaces then we get a list and then we run a for loop on it and then in the
for loop we use re.search() function to search for the word if the word is present then we
append it into a new list and return it.
