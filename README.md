# Assignment - 5

Solve the 2 problems in .py files.
```
01_smart_artist.py
02_stuttering_keyboard.py
```

Each file contains few functions, for which you have to write the implementation.

After completing the implementation to check the correctness. 
Use the following command, in the terminal. Example to test the correctness of the first problem.
```
python 01_smart_artist.py
```

*Note: Once you solve a problem, **immedietly write your observation** for the solved problem. Only after writing obsevation for the solved problem, start solving another problem.*

## Write your observations
In the file, `03_observation.txt` write the following observations.
+ What is the first logic that you thought of for solving the problem?
+ What are the problems you faced while implementing your first logic?
+ Did you modify the logic to solve it or did the first logic worked?

Answer these 3 questions after solving each problem.
